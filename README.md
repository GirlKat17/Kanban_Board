# Kanban Board
## Overview
After completing the Agile Project Management course with Google, I gained valuable insights into effective project organization. One key takeaway was the significance of using a Kanban board to track team progress. The Kanban board utilizes a layout that categorizes tasks into three main stages: Backlog, In Progress, and Done. This approach provides a clear visualization of the team's accomplishments and outstanding work.
## Technologies Used

- Angular Framework: I implemented the project using Angular, a powerful and versatile web application framework.<br>

- Bulma CSS Framework: To enhance the project's visual appeal, I utilized the Bulma CSS framework for efficient and responsive styling.

## Kanban Board Layout
### The Kanban board is structured around three main stages:

1. Backlog: This section outlines the tasks that are planned for the project but not yet started.<br>

2. In Progress: Tasks that are actively being worked on are moved to this stage, providing a real-time view of ongoing development efforts.<br>

3. Done: Completed tasks are moved to this stage, serving as a comprehensive record of the team's achievements.<br>

## Benefits
Implementing a Kanban board has proven to be instrumental in fostering collaboration and enhancing project transparency. It enables the development team to easily grasp what has been accomplished and what tasks are yet to be completed.
